Numerous travelers face the challenge of optimizing their itineraries to experience the best of a city like San Francisco, balancing desires to see key attractions like the Golden Gate Bridge at sunrise, explore museums at opening hours, and enjoy local cuisine, all while managing constraints like budget and transportation. The conventional approach of manually planning such trips is time-consuming and often leads to suboptimal experiences, especially for those without a car, relying heavily on expensive ride-sharing services to navigate the city.

Our project proposes the development of an Itinerary Optimization Tool, designed to generate personalized travel plans from a given list of sights, trip duration, hotel locations, budget limits, and transportation preferences. This tool aims to accommodate specific visitation time preferences for attractions and efficiently organize a traveler's schedule to minimize external transport costs and maximize the enjoyment of their stay.

By employing advanced algorithms to analyze various factors—including attraction opening hours, public transportation schedules, and personal preferences—our tool will offer an optimized, user-friendly itinerary. This solution not only promises to enhance the travel experience by reducing the stress of planning and cost of transportation but also provides an opportunity for the team to develop critical skills in software development, user experience design, and data analytics.

Through tackling this real-world issue, the project offers a platform for practical learning and the potential for a scalable startup. By the semester's end, the team will have not only created a valuable tool for travelers but also gained insights into the process of developing technology-driven solutions to complex challenges.
